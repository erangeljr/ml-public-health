    "\n",
    "I'm going to walk through how we might work towards building a first machine learning model. But first, let's briefly discuss what machine learning is. This is going to be a rough crash course -- ask questions if you feel there's a gap!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation for Machine Learning\n",
    "For many problems, it's sufficient to write a deterministic program to solve it. For example, if you want to find the sum of all numbers between 1 and 1 million, we could write a python program such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sum([i for i in range(1000000)])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some problems that are more difficult to solve via computing. For example, how would you write a program to detect a face? This is a task that seems easy for most people -- easy to the extent that it is unconscious. But writing a program to perform such a task is difficult!\n",
    "\n",
    "This difficulty is the motivation for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "If we don't know the process for detecting faces, what if we learn that process? Let's frame our facial detection problem a bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an image, we want to determine whether or not a face exists in that image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we've already given up on directly programming the process of detecting a face, how might we go about learning that process?\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we typically give some data to an algorithm for \"learning\" and then you can use what that algorithm learned to make predictions about new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the facial detection example, we might provide many images, each with a label - \"Yes\" if it contains a face or \"No\" if it does not (in practice this could be 1 and 0, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is used to _train_ a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training\n",
    "We call the process of a model learning from data \"training.\" In this, we typically give a model some data (often with the correct answers -- hence the label) and let it tweak itself according to some algorithm to get answers right more often. Think of this as homework: you often have some answers for homework questions so that you can try the problem yourself and then score yourself to see how well you did. This let's you improve your own score before it really counts (i.e. on the test).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our facial detection example, you would give the model an image and let the model predict whether or not a face was in the image. Then you'd score the model prediction with the real label (we'll talk about how we score in a bit). The training algorithm will then tweak the model in light of a this score to do more of the things that get right answers and less of the things that get wrong answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I'm being intentionally vague here about \"algorithm\" because there are many such algorithms. Specific algorithms are outside the scope of this workshop, but if you're interested, feel free to talk to me about it afterwards!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Evaluation\n",
    "You don't give your models homework for practice (in the form of training data) for no reason. Eventually, you'll want to evaluate to see how well your model performs. Just as (most) teachers wouldn't give you the answer key to the test, the model should be given new data *without* labels to see how well it performs with respect to the true labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a real test, the model gets a score. But we don't improve our model from this score like before. This score tells us a bit about how \"good\" our model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This score concept keeps coming up; how do we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scoring (Loss Function)\n",
    "We score models with what's known as a loss function. This is just something that tells you how \"wrong\" a prediction is. For instance, predicting that a picture of a Honda is a picture of a snake is more wrong than predicting that it's a picture of a Subaru. The loss function dictates how to assign a numerical value to dictate the \"wrongness\" of a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment\n",
    "Once you decide your model's evaluation score is good enough, you might decide to deploy and use it for some application! Just like any other code, be wary of bugs -- they can be oh-so-subtle in machine learning. With great power, comes a lot of testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop\n",
    "We'll be looking at breast cancer data taken from the UCI machine learning repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29 [1].\n",
    "This dataset provides several features about tumors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample code number: id number \n",
    "2. Clump Thickness: 1 - 10 \n",
    "3. Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10 \n",
    "4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10 \n",
    "5. Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10 \n",
    "6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10 \n",
    "7. Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10 \n",
    "8. Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10 \n",
    "9. Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10 \n",
    "10. Mitoses: 1 - 10 \n",
    "11. Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)\n",
    "\n",
    "A description of these parameters can be found below [2]:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Clump thickness: Benign cells tend to be grouped in monolayers, while cancerous cells are often grouped in multilayers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Uniformity of cell size/shape: Cancer cells tend to vary in size and shape. That is why these parameters are valuable in determining whether the cells are cancerous or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Marginal adhesion: Normal cells tend to stick together. Cancer cells tends to loos this ability. So loss of adhesion is a sign of malignancy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Single epithelial cell size: Is related to the uniformity mentioned above. Epithelial cells that are significantly enlarged may be a malignant cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bare nuclei: This is a term used for nuclei that is not surrounded by cytoplasm (the rest of the cell). Those are typically seen in benign tumours. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bland Chromatin: Describes a uniform \"texture\" of the nucleus seen in benign cells. In cancer cells the chromatin tend to be more coarse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normal nucleoli: Nucleoli are small structures seen in the nucleus. In normal cells the nucleolus is usually very small if visible at all. In cancer cells the nucleoli become more prominent, and sometimes there are more of them.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll dig into this dataset and try to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I have made some slight modifications to the dataset to make it easier to use.\n",
