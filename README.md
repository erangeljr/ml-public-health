# Machine Learning for Public Health (Bakersfield College Hackathon)

This workshop intends to help you get your feet wet with machine learning
on a public health related problem. By no means will this workshop make you
a machine learning expert -- you'll definitely walk out here with deep holes
in your knowledge of machine learning. However, the hope is that you get enough
bits of information that you can fill in the gaps as you continue to learn in
the future.

Machine learning is a powerful tool, and public health is a sector rich with
data and problems to apply machine learning to. Maybe you can take what you
learn here as a starting point to making waves in the world of public health.

If you want an easier installation time, I recommend installing
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). However, I'll provide some
brief installation instructions of everything.

To start, you'll need python and a few python libraries installed.

Make sure you have python 3 installed, if not, download and install here:
[Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Open a terminal / command shell 
Check your python version: `which python`
Make sure this is a version greater than 3! If not, you may have another
version of python installed or some PATH variable may be incorrectly set.

Execute the following to install the libraries we'll be using:
```
pip install numpy pandas sklearn jupyter
```

This should install all necessary dependencies.

From there you should be able to execute `jupyter notebook` which will start
a local notebook server and then you can open the
`Machine Learning in Public Health.ipynb` file. We'll do all of our work from
there.
